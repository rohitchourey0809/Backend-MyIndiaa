## Project Description

This project is a backend application for an e-commerce platform designed to handle user authentication, product catalog, and order processing. The application uses JWT for authentication, MongoDB for data storage, and integrates with mock payment gateways and logistics providers.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization using JWT
- Product management (CRUD operations)
- Order processing and management
- Integration with mock third-party services (payments and logistics)
- Secure data handling and storage
- Performance optimization for high-volume requests

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Helmet
- CORS
- Morgan

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

Usage
Start the server:


npm start
The server will be running at http://localhost:8080.

API Documentation


Authentication


```Register: POST /api/auth/register```

```Request body: { "name": "John Doe", "email": "johndoe@example.com", "password": "password123" }```


Login: POST /api/auth/login
`Request body: { "email": "johndoe@example.com", "password": "password123" }`


Products

`Get All Products:`

```

 GET /api/products

```


`Create Product:` 

```

POST /api/products

```


`Request body:`

`{ "name": "Sample Product", "price": 29.99, "description": "This is a sample product", "category": "Sample Category", "stock": 100 }`


## Orders


`Get Orders:`


 ```
 GET /api/orders (requires authentication)

 ```

`Create Order: `

```

POST /api/orders (requires authentication)

```


`Request body:`

```
{
  "products": [
    {
      "product": "product_id",
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ],
  "totalAmount": 59.98
}
```

Testing
Use Postman or cURL to test the API endpoints. Ensure to include the JWT token in the Authorization header for protected routes.

Example cURL request to get orders:

bash

curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/orders -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>"

Security Measures
SSL/TLS for secure communication
Input validation
Rate limiting
Secure storage of sensitive information
Scalability and Performance Optimization
Optimized database queries
Efficient API design to handle high volume of requests
Use of indexes in MongoDB for faster query execution
